            <p>It is believed that almost all people in the world only live for themselves but in
                human history, there are examples of many humans who offered their lives in the service
                of philanthropy and others.</p>
            <p><b>Mother Teresa</b> is also one of such great people who only lived for others. Mother
                Teresa is such a name that, when remembered, our heart is filled with conviction and a
                special respect for her is seen on the face.</p>
            <p>Mother Teresa was such a great soul whose heart was beating for all the sick,
                helpless and poor people of the world, and that is why she put her whole life in
                service and well-being.

                <p>Her real name was 'Agnes Gonxha Bojaxhiu'. Gonza is the Albanian language means flower
                    bud. There are no two opinions that Mother Teresa was a bud who had filled the fragrance
                    of love in the life of poor and helpless people at a very young age. In 1979,
                    Mother Teresa achieved her greatest symbol of recognition yet- she was awarded the
                    Nobel Peace Prize for her charity work.</p>

                <p>She treated everyone with compassion and supported them regardless of their religious
                    beliefs or social status. Her efforts helped millions of people who were suffering
                    from disease, poverty, homelessness and starvation. Her work made a difference. This 
                    women believed money is not enough. "Money can be gotten, but people need your 
                    hearts to love them"(Mother Teresa).‚ù§Ô∏è
